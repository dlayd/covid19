# Purpose

This is the single github repository for all of the NECSI efforts for coronavirus. From now on, please add your code to this directory, so that we can collaborate more effectively.

If you want to work on this, please send a pull request adding yourself to [links/contributors.md](links/contributors.md) with a description of what you are working on/what you want to work on.

# Subdirectories

## docs

This is the directory where documentation goes. Start here. This also contains a list of links to any other resources, like the "Getting Started" google doc.

## apis

This is the directory where spec for APIs, including ElasticSearch schemas goes.

## src

This is the top-level directory for all of the code that volunteers write.

Whenever you make a new visualization, please add documentation for it to "docs/visualizations.md". Ideally, you include the code in a subdirectory, but if this is not possible, then you should still add a link.

All models should also go in this.
