**The repo[sitory]** corresponds to the collaborated work of the team across one or many branches. All contributors have their own copy of it.

Each **fork** of the main repo corresponds to a contributor's work. A fork is really a Github (not Git) construct to store a clone of the repo in your user account. As a clone, it will contain all the branches in the main repo at the time you made the fork.

Each **branch** within the fork and/or in the main repo can correspond to several kinds of things, depending on how you want to work. Each branch could refer to a version of the project but can also correspond to different channels of development, like hotfixes or experimental work.

The **pull request** (in the GitHub ecosystem) corresponds to the task. Every time I want to contribute an isolated finished task to the main repo, I create a pull request corresponding to the **commits** made in that task. These commits are pulled from either my **fork** or my **branch** to the **main repo**.

A **commit** is a set of changes to the code. This is one of the most interesting things about Git. You don't transfer files, you transfer logs of changes.
