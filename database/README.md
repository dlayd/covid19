### COVID-19

Since the first confirmed case of a new, virulent strain of the coronavirus in December in Wuhan, China, the disease has spread to 75 countries. As of March 4, 2020, there are 93,090 confirmed cases and 3,198 deaths. These numbers are still increasing.

The spread of this disease is further evidence of our warning in 2006 that high levels of global connectivity have increased the likelihood a disease outbreak growing into a pandemic. Community based care remains the best model for disease containment.

This repository is the main data source repository for COVID-19 data used by [endcoronavirus.org](https://www.endcoronavirus.org/) to provide relevant information that leads to pragmatic actions for individuals, employers, governments, and NGOs.

Visualizations and dashboards at ([endcoronavirus.org](https://www.endcoronavirus.org/)) is created by the New England Complex Systems Institute.

### About Us

[endCoronavirus.org](https://www.endcoronavirus.org/) is built and maintained by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) and collaborators. Our goal is to minimize the impact of the Coronavirus COVID-19 by providing useful data and guidelines for action.

Our research team has co-faculty, students and affiliates from MIT, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities nationally and internationally. We are working around the clock to monitor and communicate the current state of the COVID-19 epidemic.

We utilize mathematically-based approaches which transcend the boundaries of physical, biological and social sciences, as well as engineering, management, and medicine.

When not focused on COVID-19, we specialize in networks, agent-based modeling, multiscale analysis and complexity, chaos and predictability, evolution, ecology, biodiversity, altruism, systems biology, cellular response, health care, systems engineering, negotiation, military conflict, ethnic violence, and international development.
