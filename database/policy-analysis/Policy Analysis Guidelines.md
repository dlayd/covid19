# Policy Analysis Guidelines 

This guideline is intended to help people to evaluate national (and possibly sub-national) response to COVID19 as evidenced by the country's policies and programs. The goal is to facilitate consistency across reports. 

**Please Note: This is an initial attempt to develop guidelines. They will be revised and suggestions for revision are encouraged.** 

## The Scorecard

The scorecard is a CSV file that rates policy across roughly 15 categories organized into five groups:

- Prevention
- Detection
- Response
- Health System
- Political System 

The full rating table is shown below:

| Group            | Category          | Criteria                                                     | Rating | Rationale |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------- |
| Prevention       | Travel (external) | All necessary warnings and restrictions on   travel to and from the country are in place |        |           |
| Prevention       | Screening         | Screenings of arrivals at airports and other   crossings are adequate |        |           |
| Detection        | Capacity          | The needed tests, including kits, reagents, and   lab processing capacity, are available. |        |           |
| Detection        | Affordability     | If tests are available, are they free or easily   affordable by everyone who needs one |        |           |
| Detection        | Guidelines        | Guidelines regarding eligibility for testing are   appropriate for the situation. |        |           |
| Response         | Communication     | Communications (1) clearly and accurately   describe the current status in fighting the pandemic (2) clearly and   accurately reflect the risks (3) provide citizens with clear guidance for   necessary precautions and actions. |        |           |
| Response         | Mobilization      | An adequate number of emergency  and   security personnel are available. These personnel have adequate PPE |        |           |
| Response         | Travel (internal) | Any domestic travel restrictions or warnings   needed are in place. Includes community quarantines. |        |           |
| Response         | Closings          | Any school, business, religious, or government   closings needed are in place. |        |           |

| Health System    | Capacity          | The health system has the capacity to treat the   likely number of patients given prevention and response efforts |        |           |
| Health System    | Protection        | All healthcare workers have access to the   necessary PPE    |        |           |
| Political System | Capability        | The government has the resources (money,   expertise, processes) and means to apply them to the pandemic |        |           |
| Political System | Will              | The political will to take the necessary steps   is demonstrably present |        |           |

These scores can be averaged and used to compare different countries.

## Scoring

Score each of the categories on a 4 point scale as shown below: 

0. Insufficient information is available to rate this category
1. Critical policy and programs are unimplemented or weakly implemented, or counterproductive policies are in place
2. Some productive policies are in place, but significant improvement required
3. Most policies and programs are in place, but some improvement is recommended
4. Everything that needs to be done has been done or is being done 

## Analyzing and Synthesizing Supporting Information

Documentation of the ratings is critical. To ensure a reasonable, accurate, and defensible rating, it's recommended that you first create a document that collects and organizes your thoughts and your supporting documentation.  

This document should collect links to all sources for numbers, examples, etc. It's important to minimize the influence of any pre-existing, *unrelated* concerns about the country's government or leadership. Be as objective as possible. 

## Example: Rating US Coronavirus Policy

| Group            | Category          | Criteria                                                     | Rating | Rationale                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Prevention       | Travel (external) | All necessary warnings and restrictions on travel to and from the country   are in place | 1      | No restrictions on incoming passengers excluding China and Iran, in spite   of major outbreaks in Europe. Ongoing imporation of new cases is all but   certain. |
| Prevention       | Screening         | Screenings of arrivals at airports and other crossings are adequate | 1      | No screening of incoming passengers excluding China and Iran |
| Detection        | Capacity          | The needed tests, including kits, reagents, and lab processing capacity,   are available. | 2      | Availability of tests is improving but continues to be an issue. CDC   confirmed counts lag significantly behind state numbers. |
| Detection        | Affordability     | If tests are available, are they free or easily affordable by everyone   who needs one | 1      | Tests only covered by insurance if patient meets CDC guidelines |
| Detection        | Guidelines        | Guidelines regarding eligibility for testing are appropriate for the   situation. | 0      | CDC recommends local providers use their judgement           |
| Response         | Communication     | Communications (1) clearly and accurately describe the current status in   fighting the pandemic (2) clearly and accurately reflect the risks (3)   provide citizens with clear guidance for necessary precautions and actions. | 2      | Communication varies from good to dangerously inaccurate, with the latter   usually originating from the President or White House officials. |
| Response         | Mobilization      | An adequate number of emergency  and security personnel are   available. These personnel have adequate PPE | 3      | There have been no shortages of personnel to date, although there have   been instances reported where responders lacked equipment and risked   infection. At least 12 states have declared emergencies giving them the   ability to use the national guard for quarantine, security, and other   opeations. |
| Response         | Travel (internal) | Any domestic travel restrictions or warnings needed are in place.   Includes community quarantines. | 1      | No domestic travel restrictions in place nationally; few if any state or   local restrictions are in place. |
| Response         | Closings          | Any school, business, religious, or government closings needed are in   place. | 2      | No national closing requirements or recommendations are in place. Few if   any required closings at the state or local level. Numerous voluntary   closings, especially among universities and colleges. |
| Response         | Gatherings        | Any warnings, restrictions, or bans on public gatherings needed to   disrupt the spread are in place. | 2      | No national restrictions or warnings in place. A few scattered bans on   gatherings at the local level, sometimes directed at a specific event, or   with multiple exclusions. |
| Health System    | Capacity          | The health system has the capacity to treat the likely number of patients   given prevention and response efforts | 1      | Weak prevention, detection and response policies suggest a rapid increase   in patients, that will likely outstrip ICU availabilty and the need for   critical equipment like respirators |
| Health System    | Protection        | All healthcare workers have access to the necessary PPE      | 2      | Data is limited by there have been some reports that not all healtcare   workers have sufficient protection |
| Political System | Capability        | The government has the resources (money, expertise, processes) and means   to apply them to the pandemic | 4      | The government has, or has the ability to aquire, all the resources   necessary to fight the pandemic |
| Political System | Will              | The political will to take the necessary steps is demonstrably present | 1      | There is little or no evidence of intent by the federal government to   actively fight the spread of the pandemic. |

## Example: Documenting US Coronavirus Policy

In the directory country-files/us there's a file called [CountryPolicyAssessment-US.md](https://country-files/us/CountryPolicyAssessment-US.md). This file was used to organize the information that went into the scorecard above. It's more detailed and includes embedded links to the source documents. 

A template for that kind of analysis is shown below, but feel free to use whatever format works.

# Country Policy Assessment Template

## *Country Name*

Last update: [March-7-2020]

# **Summary**

> Summarize the key points from the findings below. It probably makes sense to write this last.

# Baseline Capabilities

> In the short term, countries have limited resources available. The recommendations should take those resource limitations into consideration. In the example below, the Global Health Security Index data was used for the US. It has entries for most countries. It's probably good to included it, but feel free to augment it with other info as needed.
>
> The Johns Hopkins' [Global Health Security Index](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ghsindex.org/&sa=D&ust=1583972042003000) rated the US #1 in the world for pandemic preparedness, while also finding that no country was fully prepared. That report provides the baseline for assessing the US response to COVID-19.
>
> Overall, the country scored 83.5 for preparedness, on a scale of 0-100, with 100 being the best. Scores for individual categories are shown below, followed by the global average in parentheses:
>
> - Prevention: 83.1 (34.8)
> - Detection & Reporting: 98.2 (41.9)
> - Rapid Response: 79.7 (38.4)
> - Health System: 73.8 (26.4)
> - Compliance with International Norms: 85.3 (48.5)
> - Risk Environment: 78.2 (55.0)

# COVID19 Specific **Concerns**

> Given the baseline capabilities from above, this section highlights particular challenges that a country might have given the specific challenges posed by COVID19.  In the US, example, this included, an aging population, the enormous transportation network, and concerns about the capacity of the health system. That section used a metric called age-adjusted hospital beds. It's calculation is shown below 
>
> Age-adjusted hospital beds.
>
> Number of hospital beds per thousand
>
> divided by
>
> Number of residents over 65 per thousand.
>
> For comparison, the South Korea has the highest score of countries where data is available:
>
> - Percent of population age 65 or older having: 14.
> - Population per 1,000 age 65 or older: 140.  
> - Hospital beds per 1,000: 12.27 (2017 figure)
>
> Age adjusted hospital beds score = 12.27 / 140 = 0.087

# Current Pandemic Status

> This section is used to discuss, briefly the countries current status according to the NECSI zone color scheme aka 'Alert Codes'.  If there are regional differences, include them here.

# Assessment of Current Policies

> This is where you write up your analysis of the situation for purposes of scoring the policy response. Be sure to consider all aspects of that model: Prevention, Detection, Response, Health System, & Political System. and include the categories in each group. In the political section it's important to keep in mind any issues that might prevent it from doing what it should do given its capabilities

# Action Recommendations

> This is where you can highlight the most important recommendations given the current state. You should based it on the protocol guidelines: [https://www.endcoronavirus.org/map](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.endcoronavirus.org/map&sa=D&ust=1583972042021000), but adjust as necessary for what has already be done, or what you think should be done in this country at this time.
